Hi there! I am an aspiring machine learning (ML) researcher who loves to tinker with deep learning models to make them more fun.


I hope to join a great Ph.D. program ~~next~~ this year :upside_down_face: (I did).


You can find my contact info to reach out [down below](#social-section).

I can't think of more to add to the description. So, here is the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions[^1] until I find the optimal one.

$$
\begin{aligned}
min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \ & f(x) \\
\text{subject to } &  c_i(x) = 0,\quad i \in \mathcal{E} \textit{ (the equality constraints)} \\
& c_i(x) \geq 0,\quad i \in \mathcal{I} \textit{ (the inequality constraints)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose that $x^*$ is a local solution, that the functions $f$ and $c_i$ are
continuously differentiable, and that the LICQ holds at $x^∗$.

Then there is a Lagrange multiplier vector $
\lambda^∗$, such that the following conditions are satisfied at $(x^∗, \lambda^∗)$:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla f(x^∗) - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{I} } \lambda^*_i \nabla c_i(x^*)  &= 0, \\
c_i(x^*) &= 0,\quad \text{ for all } i \in \mathcal{E} \\
c_i(x^*) &\geq 0,\quad \text{ for all } i \in \mathcal{I} \\
\lambda^*_i &\geq 0,\quad \text{ for all } i \in \mathcal{I} \\
\lambda^*_i c_i(x^*) &= 0,\quad \text{ for all } i \in \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{I} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
